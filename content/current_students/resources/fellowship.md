In the fall semester, we hold a fellowship workshop with incoming students. Typically second year students who received fellowships the previous year lead the workshop. We'll help you find fellowships that you qualify for, professors to talk to about recommendations, and edit your essays. The workshop has been very successful. See [previous achievements]({{<ref "/current_students/achievements.md">}}).

The national and private fellowships that people most commonly apply for are:

- [NSF Graduate Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/)
- [National Defense Science and Engineering Fellowship](https://ndseg.asee.org/)
- [Ford Predoctoral Fellowship](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/FordFellowships/PGA_047958)
