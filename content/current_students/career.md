Here is a selection of links which you might find helpful and encouraging while working your way through your Master's or PhD.

## General Wisdom
- [Advice for Graduate Students in Statistics (2007)](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~steele/Rants/AdviceGS.html) by Michael J. Steele, Upenn Statistics
- [Career Advice](http://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/) from Terence Tao, UCLA Mathematics. A nice list of his own blog posts as well as links to other sources of sage advice for graduate students
- [Essays and musings](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/Blog/not_blog.html) by David Aldous, Cal Statistics. A collection of his thoughts on topics like mathematical research, and writing and reading mathematics.

## About Conference Papers and Posters
- [Conference paper guide](http://www.cgu.edu/pages/861.asp) from Claremont Graduate University

## About Writing Papers
- Don't delay in writing a result once you think you have proved it. Force yourself to sit down and write down the proof there and then.
- Writing half a page a day would give you a thesis in a year. Don't be afraid to sit down and write down some ideas.
- [MathSciNet](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/) provides an excellent way of getting Bibtex entries. [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is also very good. Go to Settings -> Bibliographic Manager and choose Bibtex for "Show links to import into." Then whenever Google Scholar returns search results you will see a link for "Import into Bibtex."
- Practice LaTeX! Do all your homework in it.
